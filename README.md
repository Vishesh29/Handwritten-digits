# GUI based Handwritten Digits Recognition
Training, Evaluating and Testing K-nearest neighbors algorithm to Identify Handwritten Digits.  

Handwritten Digits Recognition-PC App/ Web App Development Using Tkinter.

# KNN :
K-nearest Neighbor is a Non parametric ,lazy and supervised machine learning algorithm used for both Classification and Regression. It predicts the class of the new data point by majority of votes of k nearest neighbors based on the similarity measure(ie., distance functions)

# MNIST Dataset :

MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)dataset contains total of 70,000 handwritten digits labeled images from 0 to 9.Handwritten digits are images in the form of 8*8 gray scale intensities of images representing an image along with the first column to be a label (0 to 9) for every image.
