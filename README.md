# Handwritten-digits
Training, Evaluating and Testing K-nearest neighbors algorithm to Identify Handwritten Digits.

Handwritten Digits Recognition-PC App/ Web App Development Using Tkinter & Flask

# KNN :
K-nearest Neighbor is a Non parametric ,lazy and supervised machine learning algorithm used for both Classification and Regression.
It predicts the class of the new data point by majority of votes of k nearest neighbors based on the similarity measure(ie., distance functions)

# MNIST Dataset :

MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)dataset contains total of 70,000 handwritten digits labeled images from 0 to 9.
Handwritten digits are images in the form of 28*28 gray scale intensities of images representing an image along with the first column to be a label (0 to 9) for every image.
